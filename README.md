# dudo

This is a web sockets implementation of the multiplayer dice game dudo (available to play at rykennedy.com). 

Built with a React frontend and socket-io backend.

To test the game, run "npm run dev" from backend, and "npm start" from frontend.

Then open up two browser tabs (in different browsers, or one in incognito) and go to localhost:3000

You should then be able to sign in and play (against yourself in this dev scenario).
