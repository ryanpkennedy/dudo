1) Work on individual socket messaging (based on id)
    - needed for validation
    for example: on login
        client emits login attempt to Server
        server checks that lobby isnt full and username is valid
            if not, then server emits error back to individual client socket
            if login successful, server emits new user to all client sockets

Key Components of lobby / login
    x Need Username, Room, and AvatarSelection to join. Cant send join event without these three filled out
    - Room needs to be available 
        x not full, 
        - and not closed
    - Username needs to be available within room

If on Login screen, storageId is empty. So refresh is simple and easy

Once in Lobby, if you refresh, need to use storageId to fetch state from server
    - or should certain game state also be kept in browser storage?

If you logout of lobby, name is removed from room

If you close tab, and then go back to page
    - sometimes you want to get back into your previous room
    - other times you do not

What happens if someone randomly tries to login to a room that is being used elsewhere?
- include an "open" property in the room
- can switch this to false, when the game starts, that way no one in some other location can accidently log in to this room

Store SocketId with User Object in Room Object
    Ex: db : {
        ASDF: {
            Ryan: {
                socketId: 'ads987asdf', 
                avatarSelection: 'male',
            }
        }
    }

socket.on('disconnect', (username, room) => {
    delete db[room][username].socketId
}

so now there is no socketId attached to the given user
but that user still has his custom id = "room_username" in localstorage
so if the user reconnects, you take the customId to index into the given user in the db
and then assign it the new socketId, checking that it doesnt have a socketId first

this way, 

Generalize 'update-state' function. So you can emit from wherever with universal functionality. Pass in what you want the new state to be, and updated state gets emitted

Need to move 'db' which is just node object database, which will never actually remove rooms, to a redis based db
